# Formula_1_Podium_Classifier_with_PySpark

The project aims to perform a classification task on Formula 1 data about drivers, circuits, constructors, 
races, qualifications and results, in order to predict to finish on podium. 
To gather data for the study, different Kaggle csv files were merged together by using their foreign keys –
ID_features – and then three machine learning models were used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest 
Classifier, Linear Support Vector Machine. 
Among them, the Logistic Regression was chosen as the favorite model, thanks to its performances in 
prediction and inference (as good as others models’ performances) and its computational time (1/2 respect 
to SVC, 1/4 respect to Random Forest Classifier).
